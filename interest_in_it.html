  <p><h3> What sparked my interest in IT?</h3></p>

<p>I remember my first computer lesson and it was mind blowing, the things that those computers could do was amazing.  Like every other young student I was in it for the games. Played Doom3D a lot and over the years all sorts of games. Seeing the rapid development in that area, from floppy discs to portable mp3 players. Was amazed of technology. That was a start of my initial interest of IT.

</p>

<p> Now 20 years later I have learned to use different tools from media editing to CAD design and Z Brush sculpting for 3D printing and rapid prototyping.</p>
Last Christmas, I was working on a shopfitting project where we had to make some display windows move with stepper motors and Arduino boards. I thought that was easy to do and without much prior background took the lead on the task. Quickly understood that I donâ€™t understand anything about that. Luckily for us a friend of a friend saved the day , or night, should I say, writing the programs all night in the shop.

<p>The reason I chose RMIT is that it gives the flexibility with time management, but also there is a sense of urgency. Having the  opportunity to study on the road is great, as I like to travel around quite a bit. So far lack of urgency has really stopped me from progressing forward with my skills. Also like that everything is well structured to support the learning process.

I expect to learn new skills, starting from being proficient in Python but also about network systems and other programming technique. Looking forward to understand the methods and tools used in computer world.  Hopefully able to write useful programs that make life better at work and home.
