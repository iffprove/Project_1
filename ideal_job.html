      <p>I have positioned myself perfectly having pretty much no skills for this job. This gives me an opportunity to have a clear view what do I have to learn to become a good penetration tester.
</p>
<p>I have got a leading hand position experience in manufacturing environment for about 5 years. With very strict deadlines, and coordinating the work of a small team, I believe to have a good stress tolerance with difficult situations.

</p>
<p><h3>Steps for the position</h3></p>
      <p>Firstly, I need to get a solid foundation in Information Technologies. For that a bachelorâ€™s in information technologies is a good start.
With that I can get a job as a system or a network administrator.

<p>Some time at that position and further training should make me employable in the field</p>
<p>So to conclude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting a degree in IT</li>
  <li>Get proffessional experience, will have to work in an entry level position for a while to gain real life experience</li>

  <p><h3>Who is penetration tester?</h3></p>
  <p>Penetration tester also called as an ethical hacker. As far as education, good starting place would be a bachelor degree in the field of IT, cybersecurity or computer science. Need to have a good knowledge of network systems and  different operation systems </p
    <p>I think the ability to think outside of the box would greatly benefit someone looking into that position.  In the long, run as the technology is rapidly advancing ,  desire to learn new things and stay updated about changes is a must.</p>
    <p>Currently have little knowledge of anything regarding IT so means that I have lot to learn about the tools of trade. On the other hand as I have worked in different industries over the years in different countries I have a good knowledge of how systems are being used in real life.</p>
